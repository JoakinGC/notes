# IBM Aplicaction

Autor/s: Contreras Joaquin

To ensure the proper initialization of the application, the following dependencies are required:

1. **Dependency Addition:**

Add the following dependency in your project-level Gradle file:

````gradleCopy
implementation("androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.6.2") // Fragment
````

2. **Binding Configuration:**

Enable view binding in your project by including the following in your module-level Gradle file:

````gradleCopy
buildFeatures {
	viewBinding = true 
}

````

For older versions of Android Studio, use:

````
viewBinding {     
	enable = true
 }
````

Once synchronization is complete, the project can be utilized properly.

Please ensure that the main activity is titled "ImcActivity". In case it doesn't start as the main screen, verify the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the activity with the name "ImcActivity" and include:

xmlCopy code

````xml
<intent-filter>  
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />  
  
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />  
</intent-filter>
````

This will help designate "ImcActivity" as the main launcher activity
